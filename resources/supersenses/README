Supersenses are coarse semantic categories originating in WordNet. 
For nouns and verbs there are 45 classes: 26 for nouns and 15 for verbs, 
for example, noun.body, noun.animal, verb.consumption, or verb.motion.

wn_noun.supersneses and wn_noun.supersneses files contain 
feature vectors for WordNet nouns and verbs. 
A word can belong to several synsets, which are associated with 
different supersenses. Degrees of membership in different 
supersenses are represented by feature vectors, where each element 
corresponds to one supersense. For example, the word head (when used as a noun) 
participates in 33 synsets, three of which are related to the 
supersense noun.body. The value of the feature corresponding to this 
supersense is 3/33 â‰ˆ 0.09


English adjectives do not, as yet, have a similar high-level 
semantic partitioning, so we created one (forthcoming, LREC): wn_adj.supersneses.
