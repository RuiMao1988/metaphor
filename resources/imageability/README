The MRC psycholinguistic database --http://ota.oucs.ox.ac.uk/headers/1054.xml-- 
is a large dictionary listing linguistic and psycholinguistic attributes 
obtained experimentally (Wilson,1988). It includes, among other data, 
4,295 words rated by the degrees of abstractness and 1156 words rated by the 
imageability.
 
We use a supervised learning algorithm to propagate abstractness 
and imageability scores to all words for which we have vector space 
representations. We calculate the degree of abstractness and imageability 
of English words  using vector elements as features. 
Abstractness and imageability rankings from the MRC database are used as 
a training set (at en_training_data/*).
Propagated degrees of abstractness and imageability are 
posterior probabilities of classifier predictions. 
Classifier output is at en/abstractness.predictions

We binarize these posteriors into abstract-concrete (or imageable-unimageable) 
boolean indicators using pre-defined thresholds.
Thresholds are equal to 0.8 for abstractness and to 0.9 for imageability, 
they were chosen empirically based on accuracy during cross-validation. 
Performance of these classifiers, tested on a sampled held-out data, 
is 0.94 and 0.85 for the abstractness and imageability classifiers, respectively.
